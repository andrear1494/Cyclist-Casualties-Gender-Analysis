# README: Cyclist Casualties Gender Analysis
# Project Overview
This repository contains the analysis of gender differences in cyclist casualties and injury risks in England, using secondary data from the STATS19 dataset (which records personal injury accidents on public roads) and the National Travel Survey (NTS) for the year 2019. The study investigates whether gender has a statistical impact on the likelihood of being involved in a cycling accident, suffering a fatal or serious injury (KSI), and the relationship between cycling frequency or duration and injury risks.

The analysis was conducted using SPSS for statistical testing and Excel for the final risk calculation.

# Introduction
Cycling, as an active form of transportation, holds significant potential to transform urban mobility. When embraced widely, cycling offers numerous benefits in terms of health, the environment, and economy. However, despite its advantages, cycling remains a minority mode of transport in England, with safety being a key barrier to broader adoption. Cyclists, as vulnerable road users, are disproportionately affected by road accidents and fatalities.

The study focuses on examining gender differences in cyclist injury risks, particularly whether men and women face different odds of being involved in cycling accidents or suffering from severe injuries. By analyzing exposure data, the aim is to determine if these differences are simply due to varying cycling habits or more deeply rooted in other factors.


# Objectives
Understand the gender differences in cycling accident rates.
Assess if men are more prone to fatal or severe injuries (KSI) compared to women.
Analyze whether men tend to cycle longer distances and durations than women, contributing to the higher exposure risk


Research Hypotheses
The study aims to test the following hypotheses:

Cycling Crash Likelihood by Gender: Compared to women, men are more likely to be involved in crashes when cycling.
KSI Risk by Gender: Male cyclists are at higher risk of suffering a KSI (killed or seriously injured) compared to female cyclists.
Cycling Exposure by Gender: Men cycle for longer trips and duration compared to women, which might explain differences in injury rates.
Data Sources
STATS19 (2019): Datasets covering accidents and casualties on public roads in England, extracted and merged for analysis.
National Travel Survey (NTS 2019): Annual household survey tracking travel behavior and trends, used to calculate cycling exposure by gender.
